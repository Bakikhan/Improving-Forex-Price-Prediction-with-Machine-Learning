Excited to share my recent project on Forex price prediction using various machine learning regression models! In this project, I've used historical forex data, added technical indicators, and compared different regression models to find the best one for predicting future prices.

Here are the models I've tested:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net Regression
Support Vector Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
XGBoost
LightGBM
CatBoost
I performed cross-validation to evaluate each model based on their mean squared error and R-squared score. After comparing their performance, I saved the best performing model to use for future price predictions.

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in the finance domain and its potential to help traders make more informed decisions. Feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions on how I can further improve this project!
